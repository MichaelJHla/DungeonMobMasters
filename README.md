# Dungeon Mob Masters
###### By Jonah Hlastala

### Game overview
This game is a single player strategy game where you are in charge of managing the mobs (or enemies) of a dungeon.
The user will take control of individual mobs to try and stop 'hero' characters who will be increasing in strenght gradually.
The goal of the game is to protect the dungeon for as long as possible.

### Gameplay
The game is a top down 2D action game. The main fighting mechanic being shooting mechanics, however I would like to add 
melee mechanics in the future. Currently the user can hotswap between charaters and shoot with those characters.
The currently implemented controls are as follows:

- WASD control movement of the currently selected object
- left mouse is clicked to shoot a bullet to the cursor location
- Q and E are used to swap between the different characters
- The mouse wheel is used to swap between the different characters
- The number keys can be used to swap between the different characters
- The R key is used to reset the room
- Tab can be used to view the whole room (This is in early stages and needs A LOT of fine tuning)

### Development
The game is developed using GameMaker Studio 2. This program allows the best usability for a novice game developer such
as myself. The game is currently in an ealry pre-alpha stage as much of the mechanics still need to be thought out and written.
There is likely to be a lot of changes in terms of design to the game in the future. Currently there is no sense of character progression.
As of now, just the basic mechanics such as shooting, moving, and camera movement is being worked on.
