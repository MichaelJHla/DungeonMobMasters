# Dungeon Mob Masters
###### By Jonah Hlastala

### Game overview
This game is a single player strategy game where you are in charge of managing the mobs (or enemies) of a dungeon.
The user will take control of individual mobs to try and stop 'hero' characters who will be increasing in strenght gradually.
The goal of the game is to protect the dungeon for as long as possible.

### Gameplay
The game is a top down 2D action game. The main fighting mechanic being shooting mechanics, however I would like to add 
meelee mechanics in the future. Currently the user can hotswap between charaters and shoot with those characters.
The currently implemented controls are as follows:

- WASD control movement of the currently selected object
- arrow keys are used to shoot in 8 different directions
- Q and E are used to swap between the different characters

### Development
The game is developed using GameMaker Studio 2. This program allows the best usability for a novice game developer such
as myself. The game is currently in an ealry pre-alpha stage as much of the mechanics still need to be thought out and written.
There is likely to be a lot of changes in terms of design to the game in the future.
